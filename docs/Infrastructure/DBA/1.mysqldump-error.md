# mysqldump Error: Unknown table ‘COLUMN_STATISTICS’ in information_schema (1109)

mysqldump 8 enabled a new flag called columm-statistics by default. When you have MySQL client above 8 and try to run mysqldump on older MySQL versions, you will get the error below.

```bash
mysqldump: Couldn't execute 'SELECT COLUMN_NAME, JSON_EXTRACT(HISTOGRAM '$"number-of-buckets-specified"')
FROM information_schema.COLUMN_STATISTICS WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'myschema'
AND TABLE_NAME = 'craue_config_setting';': Unknown table 'COLUMN_STATISTICS' in information_schema (1109)
```

The solution is simple. We can either run `mysqldump` with `–column-statistics=0` as below.

`mysqldump --column-statistics=0 ...`

We can also disable this globally by adding mysqldump config in my.cnf file.

```
[mysqldump]
column-statistics=0
```

With Mac, my.cnf is in /usr/local/etc. You can check the version of your mysqldume with mysqldump `–version`.
