# Fixing No Compiler is Provided in this Environment Error for Maven Project with Eclipse

When you try to run a Maven project Java Servlet app first time, you might get this No Compiler is Provided error

```bash
Eclipse/Maven error: “No compiler is provided in this environment”
The solution is simple. You need to add tools.jar to installed JRE.
```

(1) Eclipse –> Window –> Preference
(2) Search with Installed JREs
(3) Select the version of JRE you are using and click Edit
(4) Select Standard VM and click Next
(5) Add External JARs
(6) Select tools.jar from the java/JDKx.x/lib folder
(7) Click Finish

This should fix the error.
