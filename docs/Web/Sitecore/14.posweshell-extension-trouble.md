Solutions

Simple! You need to run your MongoDB. Without connection to MongoDB, the installation hangs.

If you haven’t installed MongoDB, here is the installation instruction. For local machine, I recommend you to run MongoDB as a service.

Running MongoDB as Windows service

(1) Setting up folders

When you install MongoDB to windows, you will create a db folder as C:/data/db. In the data folder, create config and logs folders.

```
- C:
  - data
    - db
  - config
  - logs
```

(2) Adding config file

In the data folder, create a config file as mongod.cfg and add the lines below.

```bash
logpath=C:\data\logs\mongo.log
dbpath=C:\data\db
```

(3) Setting up Mongo bin path

Add `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin` to Environment Variable. This will enable you to run mongo commands from cmd.

(4) Install MongoDB to Windows service

Make sure that your MongoDB server is stopped. Run the command below.

`mongod --config "C:\data\config\mongod.cfg" --install`

(5) Check the service

You will see the MongoDB Service running.
