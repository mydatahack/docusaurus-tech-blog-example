# Calling Async Function in Action with Redux-Thunk

Redux-thunk is a simple middleware that enables you to call functions in redux action.

Thunk means function returning function. In JavaScript programming, we use thunk all the time although we may not use the name. Wikipedia has a simple example of thunk if you are interested. As the name suggests, redux-thunk is a thunk used as a middleware to inject the logic into action dispatching.

The use case is very simple. Use it when you want to call async function before dispatching the action. See the example below to retrieve the account information from a remote endpoint then update the store. Wouldn’t it be nice if we can do this in action?

```jsx
export const getPersonalData = (payload) => (dispatch) => {
  // Make AJAX call
  return postRequest(payload)
    .then((response) => {
      // Once AJAX call is successful, update the store
      dispatch(setPersonalData(response));
    })
    .catch((err) => dispatch(apiCallNotSuccess()));
};
```

By default, redux dispatch method only takes object. See the source code for the dispatch method below. The function above will cause error. It will tell you that only object can be dispatched and even tell you to use custom middleware for async action.

```jsx
function dispatch(action) {
  if (!isPlainObject(action)) {
    throw new Error(
      'Actions must be plain objects. ' +
        'Use custom middleware for async actions.'
    )
}
  ...
```

Redux-thunk is basically a custom middleware that allows function to be passed to dispatcher and get rid of the error that you get from the native dispatch function in redux.

Redux-thunk source code is famous for its brevity. Size does not matter here. It does the magic of bringing async functions into action.

This is the current redux-thunk source code.

```jsx
function createThunkMiddleware(extraArgument) {
  return ({ dispatch, getState }) =>
    (next) =>
    (action) => {
      if (typeof action === "function") {
        return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);
      }

      return next(action);
    };
}

const thunk = createThunkMiddleware();
thunk.withExtraArgument = createThunkMiddleware;

export default thunk;
```

Awesome, now you know what redux-thunk is and when to use it. It’s time to set it up

Setting up redux-thunk

Setting up is as easy as the module itself. All you need to do is to install the redux-thunk module and apply it as a middleware in the index file.

Installation

`npm i –save redux-thunk`

Index.js

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import "../public/css/bootstrap.css";
import "../public/css/custom.css";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { createStore, compose, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import reducer from "./reducers";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";

let composeEnhancers;
composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

let store = createStore(reducer, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk)));

ReactDom.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Let’s start writing action with async functions. Here are some examples. The argument can be just dispatch or dispatch + getState or dispatch + getState + your custom arguments. This gives a lot of flexibility and can add cool logic to your action.

Action.js

```jsx
export const setPersonalData = (personalData) => {
  return {
    type: UPDATE_PesonalData,
    personalData,
  };
};

export const getPersonalData = (payload) => (dispatch) => {
  // Update the store on the status of API call (optional)
  dispatch(apiCallInProgress());
  // Make AJAX call
  return postRequest(payload)
    .then((response) => {
      // Once AJAX call is successful, update the store
      dispatch(setPersonalData(response));
      // Then indicate apiCall was successful (optional)
      dispatch(apiCallSuccess());
    })
    .catch((err) => dispatch(apiCallNotSuccess()));
};

export const getPersonalData = (payload) => (dispatch, getState) => {
  // Update the store on the status of API call (optional)
  dispatch(apiCallInProgress());
  // Make AJAX call
  return postRequest(payload)
    .then((response) => {
      // we can transform response data with current state retrived with getState
      // with fictitious transformData function takes response and current state.
      const newState = transformData(response, getState);
      // Once AJAX call is successful, update the store
      dispatch(setPersonalData(newState));
      // Then indicate apiCall was successful (optional)
      dispatch(apiCallSuccess());
    })
    .catch((err) => dispatch(apiCallNotSuccess()));
};
```
