# Setting up Custom Webpack for TypeScript React

The easiest way to get started with React on TypeScript is to use create-react-app for TypeScript. As create-react-app uses webpack, you can eject config files by running npm run eject for further customisation.

What about building the project and webpack config from scratch? It is sometimes good to give it a go because you understand a little bit more about TypeScript React configuration. In this post, we will go through the steps to set up custom webpack for a TypeScript React project.

(1) Setting up folder

Here is the folder structure we use.

```bash
- root
    - src
        -components
    - public
    - dist
    - test
```

(2) Install dependencies

For all the React related modules, you need to add corresponding @type modules.

# install TypeScript

`npm i --save-dev typescript`

# install webpack

```bash
npm i --save-dev webpack
npm i --save-dev webpack-dev-server
npm i --save-dev webpack-cli

# install react and associated tools
npm i --save react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom
npm i --save-dev ts-loader source-map-loader uglifyjs-webpack-plugin
npm i --save-dev source-map-loader

# install redux
npm install -S redux react-redux @types/react-redux

# install react router
npm i -S react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```

(3) Add Webpack config

The bare minimum webpack config to get you started!

```js
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "production" : "development",
  devtool: "inline-source-map",
  entry: "./src/index.tsx",
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  devServer: {
    inline: true,
    contentBase: "./public",
    // historyApiFallback: true,
    port: 3000,
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".tsx", ".js"],
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.tsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: "ts-loader" },
      { test: /\.js$/, use: ["source-map-loader"], enforce: "pre" },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"] },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
      template: "./public/index.html",
      filename: "index.html",
    }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename: "app.css" }),
  ],
};
```

(4) Add tsconfig

On the root directly you need to add a tsconfig.json file. With TypeScript, you do not need Babel. TypeScript compiler converts the code into the version of JavaScript that runs on the browser.

If you need to import Json data directly from .json file, you need to set resolveJsonModule=true. The most importantly, skipLibCheck = true will make compilation time much faster for hot loading. Without this parameter, compilation takes noticeably longer and you will probably feel frustrated.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es5",
    "jsx": "react",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["./test/**/*"]
}
```

(5) Add scripts in package.json

We can now add script to develop and build React application in package.json file.

```json
"start": "webpack-dev-server --open",
"devbuild": "webpack --mode development",
"build": "webpack --mode production",
```

(6) File name consideration

With JavaScript, React works on both .js and .jsx extensions. With TypeScript, React only works on .tsx extension. For React components, make sure to use .tsx. The rest of the utility functions, you can use .ts extension.
