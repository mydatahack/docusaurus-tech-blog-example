# Using act() in Jest Unit Tests with React-Dom

react-dom/test-utils provides a helper, act() to make sure all the tasks like rendering, user events, and data fetching (these are considered as units of interaction with a user interface) to be processed and applied to the DOM before making an assertion.

We use act() when we are using jest with react-dom. If you are using React Testing Library, the render function is already wrapped in act(). So we don’t need to use it.

Let’s write a test to assert both async and window.open functions get called if the button component below is clicked. This is a good place to use act().

```tsx
export const MyButton = () => {
  const { someAsyncFunc } = someHook();

  const handleClick = () => {
    await someAsyncFunc();
    window.open(link, "_blank");
  };

  return (
    <button role="link" onClick={handleClick}>
      click me!
    </button>
  );
};
```

Without using act(), we cannot assert window.open to be called because the assertion happens before the async function gets executed.

```tsx
// mock async function first
const someAsyncFunc = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ success: true });
jest.spyOn(hooks, 'someHook').mockImplementation(() => ({ someAsyncFunc }));

...

act(async() => {
  wrapper
  .findWhere((node) => node.text() === 'Elenberg Fraser')
  .find('button')
  .simulate('click');
});

// This one is not necessary unless we are asserting the change in UI
// wrapper.update();

expect(someAsyncFunc).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
// Add window.open = jest.fn(); in setup.js file for jest global config
expect(window.open).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```
