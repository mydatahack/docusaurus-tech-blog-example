# Fixing it.only type error in Jest

If you are getting a type error with it.only in Jest, it could be due to incorrect TypeScript typings or incompatible versions of Jest and TypeScript.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Make sure you have the latest versions of Jest and its TypeScript typings installed in your project.

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest
```

Verify that your tsconfig.json file includes the necessary TypeScript configuration for Jest. It should have the following settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["jest"]
  }
}
```

Ensure that your test file has the correct import statement for it.only:

`import { it } from '@jest/globals';`

This import is necessary when using TypeScript with Jest to avoid type errors.

If the issue persists, please provide more details about the specific error message you are receiving so that I can assist you further.
