# What is ‘this’ referencing to in JavaScript?

the location where the function is called.

When a function’s call-site is inside an object, this refers to the object where the function belongs to. When a function’s call-site is in the window’s object, this refers to the global objects.

If you are not familiar with this, the explanation above is probably not sufficient. Let’s have a look at actual examples.

Example

Can you tell the output of this code example?

```js
var a = "global";

var check = {
  a: "hello",
  b: function () {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  c: function () {
    setTimeout(function () {
      // this becomes global because setTimeout's call site is global
      // as setTimout is window.setTimeout
      console.log(this.a);
    }, 0);
  },
  d: function () {
    // we can reassign this to _this
    var _this = this;
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(_this.a);
    });
  },
  e: function () {
    // Arrow function brings lexical scope
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(this.a);
    });
  },
};

check.b();
check.c();
check.d();
check.e();
```

**Output**

Here is the output from the code example above.

```
hello
global
hello
hello
```

**Explanation**

The function b’s call-site is the check object. Therefore, this.a refers to a that belongså to the check object.

In the function c, setTimeout’s call-site is the windows object (window.setTimeout). Therefore, this refers to the global object. Hence, this.a is from the global scope. If you delete a in the global namespace, this.a becomes undefined.

The function d uses the old school technique of reassigning this to \_this. By using \_this, setTimeout has access to the a variable within the check object.

ES6 arrow function introduced lexical scope. Therefore, this refers to the check object in the function e as we are using the arrow function for the setTimeout callback function.

Hope this helps you to clarify this.
