# SVG Attributes for Sizing Doesn’t Work on iPhone

So, my svg looked like this and I was importing it in an img tag.

```html
<!-- icon.svg has with and viewbox attributes. They should work fine -->
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  width="250px"
  viewBox="0 0 1952.00 734.93"
  enable-background="new 0 0 1952.00 734.93"
  xml:space="preserve"
>
  ...
</svg>

<!-- imported in the img tag. This should work, too... -->
<img src="img/logo.svg" alt="My Logo" />
```

I never really figured out the reason why it was happening. In the end, I opted to add css to specify with and height. This works fine for iPhone.

It is important to add both with and height because iPhone Safari doesn’t honour the viewbox attribute, either.

```html
<!-- add class name and css -->
<img src="img/logo.svg" alt="My Logo" class="my-logo-svg" />

<style>
  .my-logo-svg {
    width: 250px;
    height: 94px;
  }
</style>

<!-- inline css will work, too -->
<img src="img/logo.svg" alt="My Logo" style="width:250px;height:94px" />
```

It is a little strange that svg sizing attributes do not work. But, this is the quick win. If you have the same issue, don’t waste too much time on this. Just add with and height. If you have any other solutions, I would like to hear from you!
