# Unable to Get Local Issuer Certificate for installing Npm Modules

unable to get local issuer certificate error with yarn install from a private npm repository (such as JFrog), you can try running this command:

```bash
yarn config set "strict-ssl" false
yarn install
```

Alternatively, we can `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to `0` by `export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`

**Error message example**

```bash
error An unexpected error occurred: “https://npco.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-mdh/@mdh/my-library/-/@mdh/my-library-3.21.0.tgz: unable to get local issuer certificate”.
```
