# How to configure debugger when running jest for React unit tests with VS Code

We can debug the jest test with console.log (make sure to remove the `â€“-silent` option). But, attaching a debugger and stepping through the tests sometimes may help us to troubleshoot quicker under certain circumstances.

1. Install Jest Plugin

Install Jest plugin.

2. Configure

Press `cmd + shift + p`.

Find Jest: Setup Extension (Beta)

Add yarn test (or any test command you usually use for running tests) as Setup Jest Command.

Add launch.json with Setup Jest Debug Config. By using the wizard, it will automatically generate launch.json according to the yarn test command.

3. Run

Add breakpoint and run individual test from the test file. You can see Debug above the test scenario and click it. See the plugin doc for further info.
