# Getting Redux DevTools to Work with TypeScript

Redux DevTools is a chrome extension that enables developers to see Redux state change in the browser’s console. This post is a quick reference to set up your TypeScript react file so that you can debug your code with Redux DevTools.

For normal JavaScript, it will be easy. You can just pass composeEnhancer() into the store with the property **REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE** as below. This code goes into the index.jsx or wherever you wrap entire app with Provider in the ReactDom.render() method.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { createStore, compose } from "redux";

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

const store = createStore(reducers, composeEnhancers());

ReactDom.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("react")
);
```

On the other hand, TypeScript does not know the type of the property. Therefore, you will get the error; Property ‘**REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE**’ does not exist on type ‘Window’.

Hence, you need to add the property to the global window as below.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { createStore, compose } from "redux";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

declare global {
  interface Window {
    __REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__?: typeof compose;
  }
}

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
const store = createStore(reducer, composeEnhancers());

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
