# Starting React.js in 30 seconds

When you think about React, it is basically a Javascript library rather than a framework. This means you can import React library in the script tag in your html file and write an inline code, just like jQuery.

I previously wrote a post about setting up React development environment by using Node.js and creating a local server. It is fairly lengthy process and can be challenging if you are not used to web development.

React doesn’t need to be that complicated. If you want to do something with React, you can simply import a few libraries before the closing body tag and start writing React within the Script tag in the same html file. It really takes less than 30 seconds.

Here is what you need to do.

Set up a simple HTML file and import 3 libraries before the closing body tag as below.

```html
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"
  crossorigin
></script>
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
  crossorigin
></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
```

Then set up the script tag below. You can straight away create a React component that renders in the div above.

```html
<script type="text/babel">
  ...
</script>
```

That’s it!

Ok, here is a quick example of React button that randomly changes Bootstrap class as you click. Look how easy it is to integrate Bootstrap with React!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container text-center">
      <h1>Bootstrap Button</h1>
      <div id="root"></div>
    </div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      var buttonStyle = [
        "primary",
        "secondary",
        "success",
        "danger",
        "warning",
        "info",
        "light",
        "dark",
      ];

      function Button(props) {
        var style = buttonStyle[props.index];
        var classStyle = "btn btn-" + style;
        var className = style.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + style.slice(1);

        return (
          <button
            type="button"
            class={classStyle}
            onClick={() => {
              props.clickHandler();
            }}
          >
            {className}
          </button>
        );
      }

      class App extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = { index: 0 };
          this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this);
        }
        clickHandler() {
          this.setState({ index: Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) });
        }
        render() {
          return (
            <div>
              <Button
                index={this.state.index}
                clickHandler={this.clickHandler}
              />
            </div>
          );
        }
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
    </script>

    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
