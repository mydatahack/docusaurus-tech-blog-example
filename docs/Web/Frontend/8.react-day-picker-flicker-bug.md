# How to fix react-day-picker flickering hover state between mouseenter and mouseleave

I had an issue with `react-day-picker` flickering hover state between `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` when the cursor was on the edge of the day I was trying to select. This is not a bug in the library. It was the custom style I added to the hover state that was causing the issue. In my case, I had to override `border-radius` of the `.DayPicker-Day` element.

This fixed my issue. The fix is so specific to the component I was working on because I overrode the default style. If you’re stuck with this issue, it’s worth a try.

```css
.DayPicker-wrapper .DayPicker-Body .DayPicker-Day {
  border-radius: 0px;
}
```
