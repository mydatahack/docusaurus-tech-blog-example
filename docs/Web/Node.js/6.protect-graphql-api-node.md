# Node.js Libraries for Protecting GraphQL APIs

If you want to look beyond authentication and authorisation to protect your GraphQL APIs, there are a few Node.js libraries you can have a look at.

1. Implementing Rate-Limiting Protection

Rate-limiting will prevent too many requests coming in at once. For this, you can start with looking at [graphql-rate-limit-directive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-rate-limit-directive). It not only does rate-limiting per query, but also can do rate-limiting per user.

2. Implementing Depth-Limiting Protection

We can protect our APIs against nested queries by implementing depth-limiting protection. For this, you can check out [graphql-depth-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-depth-limit).

3. Calculate query complexity and limit queries by complexity cost

There is a cool library to calculate your query complexity and limit queries by complexity cost. Implementing this is quite simple with the library called, [graphql-validation-complexity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-validation-complexity).
