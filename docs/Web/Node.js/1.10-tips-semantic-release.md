# 9 Tips for using Semantic Release

1. Make sure to have the correct `name` value for the module in `package.json`. Include a prefix if it is necessary like this, `“name”: “@mdhnpm/react-cube-loading-spinner”`

2. Make sure to add `publishConfig` in `package.json`

```json
"publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
},
```

3. Do not set `“private”: true` if you want to publish the module. If private is true, semantic-release will skip publishing.

4. Include metadata like description, keywords, author, license and repository.

5. Use a tool like `commitizen` to ensure the commit message follows a conventional commit. Use `comitlint` in CI for the commit message check.

6. If you are publishing to the Npm repository as a public package, add `access=public` in `.npmrc`.

7. Make your package lean by adding `.npmignore` to exclude unnecessary files.

8. If you configured it well, all you need to do in CI is to run `npx semantic-release` (or `npx semantic-release –no-ci`).

9. If you want to run it as GitHub Action, use the third party semantic-release action like `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2`.
