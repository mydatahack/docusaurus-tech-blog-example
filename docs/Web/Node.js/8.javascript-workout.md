# JavaScript Workout

I made a JavaScript workout with a md file in my GitHub repo. Check out the work out [here](https://github.com/mydatahack/javascript-workout). The idea of this is to list a short JavaScript programming questions that you would encounter every day as a JavaScript developer. If you know how to do these, you don’t need to spend extra time googling the solutions. Well, googling is sometimes fine. But, it will still save you time. There is no difficult questions. Just a basic array manipulation or string formatting. But, they are not super basic either. Something you may forget and need to google the solutions if you haven’t been writing JavaScript for a while.

The entire thing is just a markdown file. There are a lot of things you can do with it as you can actually write a real HTML 5 in there. For example, I utilised a detail tag to make the answer section open and close. Pretty cool.

Try it out and see what you think.

It is still an early stage and we can expand this further. Please contribute to the project if you have good suggestions.
