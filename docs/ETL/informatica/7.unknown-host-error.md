# How To Resolve Unknown Host Name For Secure Agent In Linux

For some connectors (e.g. Marketing Cloud connector) to work in Informatica Cloud, we need to configure the host name in the server where the Secure Agent is installed. In this post, we will discuss how to resolve the unknown host name issue with Linux.

Steps

(1) Execute the command below on the secure agent machine to verify the host name of the server.

`hostname -f`

(2) Manually add an entry to /etc/hostname or /etc/hosts file for the host name resolution as below.

`&lt;IP Adress of the server&gt; &lt;Host Name&gt;`

(3) Shut down the secure agent with the command below.

`sudo /opt/infaagent/apps/agentcore/infaagent shutdown`

(4) Go to the path `{Agent Dir}/main` and open the file `infaagent.ini`. You can use the command below to find the ini file (for RedHat).

```bash
find -name infaagent.ini
```

When you find the multiple ini files, make sure to edit the latest version. The number in the path indicate the agent edition. In the example below, 27.0.16 is the latest

(5) Remove all the entries in the ini file except: `InfaAgent.MasterUrl=https://app.informaticaondemand.com/ma`

(6) Save the file and restart the agent with the command below.

```bash
sudo /opt/infaagent/apps/agentcore/infaagent startup
You may need to re-configure the agent if the startup command doesnâ€™t work. Use the command below.

sudo /opt/infaagent/apps/agentcore/consoleAgentManager.sh configure [username] [Password]
```

(7) In the cloud interface, you will see the secure agent in the right host name.

Other useful commands

To check the status of the agent

```bash
sudo /opt/infaagent/apps/agentcore/consoleAgentManager.sh getStatus
To check if the agent is configured

sudo /opt/infaagent/apps/agentcore/consoleAgentManager.sh isConfigured
```
