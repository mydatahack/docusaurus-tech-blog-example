# How To Resolve ‘orchadmin.exe: command not found’

Orchadmin is the command line utility in DataStage. The list of orchadmin commands can be found here.

It is often used to deal with the ds files. For example, you need to use orchadmin delete to remove .ds files. The .ds file does not contain the actual data. It contains the metadata to point the location of the actual data. Therefore, deleting the .ds file with ‘rm’ command does not remove the actual data.

The Grid Toolkit contains orchadmin.exe. After installing the toolkit, you will still get ‘orchadmin.exe: command not found’ without the further configuration steps.

To enable orchadmin, you need to run the command below for Linux server. The path will be different depending on how you installed DataStage.

```bash
export APT_CONFIG_FILE=/opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/Configurations/default.apt
export APT_ORCHHOME=/opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/PXEngine
export PATH=$PATH:$APT_ORCHHOME/bin
source /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSEngine/dsenv
```

The above script can be added to .bash_profile (or .bashrc, .bash_login, .profile depending on your Linux distribution) in your home dir so that you don’t need to run the script every time you need to use orchadmin.
