# How To Resolve OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

When we try to process large data with Talend Studio on your computer, you may get OutOfMemoryError.

Exception in thread “main” java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

To resolve this error, you need to increase the Xmx parameter in the config file (such as Talend-Studio-win-x86_64.ini or TOS_DI-win-x86_64.ini). By default, the value is set to 1536mb. To increase this parameter, you need to keep it mind the overall spec of your computer (especially the amount of RAM). As suggestion, you can perhaps start off with 2048 or 4096.
